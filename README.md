## Description
[Design Teardown Project](https://rawcdn.githack.com/KaushikShivam/smashing_magazine/c92981fe8f496b79836092b36f1ba27a225db6d0/index.html) is built to understand visual hierarchies with the heatmap.
In this simple project, we broke apart the website for a popular design magazine.
The goal for this exercise was to train ourselves to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

We created a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
